# LazyR README

For **me** the **"Not Funny part"** when I start a new react project is the cleaning part.
and most of the developers are Lazy uncluding me 😂😂😂
so I created an extension to clean a new react project (you know ... automation power 💪💪💪 hahah)  

## Features

    Until now the extension detect the template (js,ts) of the project and clean it depends on it... 

## Future update

    1. maybe I'll make it more generale ... so it works on any framework (i need to change the name to LazyGlobal 😂)

    2. most of the time i use tailwindcss so maybe i'll add a command to install tailwind on an existing project
    
    3. I NEED A LOGO 😂
**Enjoy and feel free to contribute !**
